# Vibration Sensor Project

#### Project Overview
The Vibration Sensor project demonstrates how to interface a vibration sensor with an Arduino Mega to detect vibrations or mechanical movements. Vibration sensors are crucial for applications where detecting physical disturbances or motion is essential.

#### Components Needed
- **Arduino Mega**
- **Vibration Sensor Module**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram

#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Vibration Sensor to Arduino Mega:**
   - **Vibration Sensor OUT Pin (vibrationPin):** Connected to digital pin 2 on the Arduino Mega.
   - **+5V Pin:** Connected to the VCC pin of the vibration sensor module.
   - **GND Pin:** Connected to the GND pin of the vibration sensor module.

#### Instructions
1. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.

2. **Testing:**
   - Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud).
   - Observe the serial output for "Vibration detected!" messages when vibrations are sensed by the sensor.
   - Tap or shake the sensor to trigger vibration detection.

#### Applications
- **Security Systems:** Use vibration sensors to detect unauthorized access or tampering.
- **Condition Monitoring:** Monitor machinery and equipment for operational status based on vibrations.
- **Alarm Systems:** Integrate vibration sensors into alarm systems for immediate alerts on physical disturbances.

#### Notes
- **Digital Output:** Vibration sensors typically provide a digital HIGH output when vibration is detected.
- **Debounce Delay:** A small delay is used to debounce the sensor and prevent false triggers due to mechanical vibrations.
- **Serial Output:** Serial communication allows real-time monitoring and logging of vibration events.
